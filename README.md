Fetching Data Using JQuery 
News Website
This is a simple news website that fetches posts from jsonplaceholder.typicode.com API and displays them. The website is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery. It is fully responsive and works well on all screen sizes.

In addition to displaying posts, the website also shows the current weather in the user's city. The weather is fetched from booked.net and displayed using a weather widget.

To enhance the design, the website also uses Font Awesome for icons and Vanilla Lazyload to lazy load images for faster page load times.

Users can view the first 8 posts on the homepage, and clicking on the "Show More" button loads another 8 posts.
